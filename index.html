    <h1>ü•ê What is a Croissant?</h1>
    <p>
      A <strong>croissant</strong> is a buttery, flaky, viennoiserie pastry of
      Austrian origin, named for its historical crescent shape. Croissants and
      other viennoiserie are made of a layered yeast-leavened dough. Croissants
      are named for their historical crescent shape. The dough is layered with
      butter, rolled and folded several times in succession, then rolled into a
      thin sheet, in a technique called laminating. The process results in a
      layered, flaky texture, similar to a puff pastry.
